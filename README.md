## Ideas and Contributions
Ideas are absolutely welcome at this stage. However, I'm not currently looking to colaborate with anyone regarding the site just yet. This is an introduction to ASP.NET for me, so until I'm more comfortable with the language and how things work, I'll be working alone for the timebeing.
